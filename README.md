We describe a concept for a fully autonomous piece of software which lives on the internet and can serve erverybody. It can offer services like search engines, selling platforms, trading, banking, and even needs which are not yet known. It is not owned by anybody, it finances itself, it lives everywhere on the planet, and it has the ability to develop further. It will be controlled not by an elite of owners or programmers, but instead by every user, through their choice of using it and paying for it.

It has the potential to survive all existing platforms known today, and may improve by evolution and environmetal pressure given by the market and all users. 

Please read the White papers including in this git repository.
